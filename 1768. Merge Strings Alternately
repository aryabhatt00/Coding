You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### Examples:
1. **Input**: `word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"`
   - **Output**: `"apbqcr"`
   - Explanation: The merged string will be: a p b q c r.

2. **Input**: `word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"`
   - **Output**: `"apbqrs"`
   - Explanation: The merged string will be: a p b q r s.

3. **Input**: `word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"`
   - **Output**: `"apbqcd"`
   - Explanation: The merged string will be: a p b q c d.
